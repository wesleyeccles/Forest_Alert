# Forest Fire Remote Detection

## Introduction

> This device is meant to be dropped from a plane/ helicopter deep into the forest. Current fire detection systems require a large infrastructure setup, however, this system is designed to drop and forget. No maintenance or even ground access is needed to deploy the system. Using LoRa as a way to communicate between nodes, the system will detect a wildfire before it can get out of hand.



## The devastation of Forest Fires

*In 2020 there were 58,950 wildfires
*~10.1 million acres were burned across the US
*4.5 million US homes currently face high/extreme wildfire risk
*The US 2020 fire season cost $130 - $150 billion in damages

##Capabilities:

*Early Warning Fire Detection
*Deep Forest Access
*Easy to Install
*No Maintenance
*Low Cost
*Scaleable
*Weather Data Tracking
*No Reception Required

##Furture Upgrades 
*Smaller Package
*Cheaper per Device
*Custom PCB
*Compostable Parachute (try and leave as little waste as possible)
*Cloud ML program to analyze the data and determine fire scenario
*Integrate into other fire detection systems
*Hikers Expiration Date Tag (remove from spot if past set amount of time)
